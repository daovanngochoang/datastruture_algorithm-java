- This is my project of self-learning datastructures and algorithms
- this link is the list of datastructures and algorithms to be checked out to get the skeleton of this project https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java,
  however, my codes and techniques are completely different with the codes and techniques in this link. 
  
+ I wrote my code and commented clearly, make it concisely and easy to review.
+ based of the list but not copy code.
+ I also wrote docs or comments to explain each of those in the code file.
